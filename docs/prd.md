# The Motivational To-Do App Product Requirements Document (PRD)

## Goals and Background Context

### Goals

*   Drive user adoption and sustained engagement by creating a tool that demonstrably helps students feel more motivated and in control of their schedules.
*   Validate the "Positive Motivation Engine" as a core feature that effectively increases task completion and user satisfaction.

### Background Context

This project aims to develop a simple-to-do application using Node.js, specifically tailored for busy college students. The primary challenge it addresses is the pervasive feeling of being overwhelmed and the resulting tendency to procrastinate among students. Traditional to-do applications often exacerbate this issue by becoming a source of guilt when users fall behind, failing to provide the necessary motivational support to combat procrastination and build positive momentum.

## Requirements

### Functional Requirements

*   **FR1:** Users must be able to create a private account, log in, and log out.
*   **FR2:** The application must provide a single, clean user interface for a logged-in user to perform all core CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations on their personal tasks.
*   **FR3:** Each task must have a description, category (e.g., 'Academics', 'Work'), a deadline, and a status (e.g., 'To Do', 'Completed').
*   **FR4:** The application must provide encouraging notifications/messages when a task is marked as complete.
*   **FR5:** The application must display simple, clear metrics like "Tasks completed today" or "Weekly completion percentage" tied to the user's account.

### Non-Functional Requirements

*   **NFR1:** The application must be a Web Application, accessible via desktop and mobile browsers.
*   **NFR2:** The application must support the latest stable versions of major browsers (Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge).
*   **NFR3:** The user interface must be fast and responsive to ensure seamless task management.
*   **NFR4:** Standard security practices must be implemented, including secure password hashing for user accounts and protection of all user data.

## User Interface Design Goals

### Overall UX Vision

The application's overall UX vision is to provide a clean, intuitive dashboard that empowers busy college students to manage their tasks effectively while fostering a sense of motivation and control. The "Positive Motivation Engine" is central to this, delivering positive feedback and encouraging messages, alongside simple, clear metrics. The aim is a coaching-style app that supports students in managing both their workload and their motivation, creating a virtuous cycle of "small wins."

### Key Interaction Paradigms

Users should be able to easily create, view, update, and delete their tasks through a streamlined interface. Key interactions will include receiving encouraging notifications upon task completion and viewing simple, clear displays of their progress metrics. The focus is on minimizing friction and maximizing positive reinforcement.

### Core Screens and Views

From a product perspective, the most critical screens and views necessary to deliver the PRD's value and goals include:

*   **Account Management Screens:** For user creation, login, and logout.
*   **Main Task Dashboard:** The central hub for managing all personal tasks.
*   **Task Detail/Edit View:** For creating new tasks and viewing/modifying existing task properties.
*   **Motivation/Metrics Display:** A dedicated area or component to show progress metrics and motivational feedback.

### Accessibility

**None**

### Branding

No specific branding elements or style guides have been identified at this stage. The design will aim for a clean, modern aesthetic by default.

### Target Device and Platforms

**Web Responsive** (accessible via desktop and mobile browsers).

## Technical Assumptions

### Repository Structure: Monorepo

For the MVP, a **Monorepo** is assumed, containing both the frontend and backend code. This simplifies development and deployment for a small team.

### Service Architecture: Monolith

A **Monolithic** architecture is assumed for the MVP. The backend will serve a REST API. This approach is sufficient for the initial scope and allows for faster development.

### Testing Requirements: Unit + Integration

For the MVP, **Unit and Integration Testing** are assumed to be the primary testing requirements. This provides a good balance of code quality and development speed.

### Additional Technical Assumptions and Requests

*   **Backend Technology:** Python, using the **FastAPI** framework. The **uv** package manager will be used for managing Python dependencies.
*   **Frontend Technology:** **Next.js** (a React framework) to create a dynamic and responsive user experience.
*   **Database:** **SQLite** will be used for the MVP to simplify setup and development. A migration path to a more robust database like PostgreSQL can be considered post-MVP.
*   **Hosting/Infrastructure:** A cloud-based platform like Vercel (ideal for Next.js) for the frontend, and a platform like Heroku or DigitalOcean App Platform for the backend.
*   **Security:** Standard security practices must be implemented, including secure password hashing for user accounts and protection of all user data.

## Epic List

*   **Epic 1: Core Application Setup:** Establish the foundational application structure, including repository setup, basic build processes, and a deployable, minimal application shell (e.g., a health check endpoint or a simple landing page) without specific user-facing features.
*   **Epic 2: User Management:** Implement secure user accounts, including registration, login, logout, and basic user profile management.
*   **Epic 3: Core Task Management:** Implement the essential task management capabilities, allowing users to create, read, update, and delete their personal tasks, along with defining basic task properties like description, category, deadline, and status.
*   **Epic 4: Positive Motivation Engine:** Develop and integrate the motivational features, including encouraging notifications upon task completion and the display of key performance metrics to foster a sense of achievement and progress.

## Epic 1: Core Application Setup

**Expanded Goal:** This epic aims to establish the fundamental technical infrastructure for the application. It will ensure that a basic, deployable application shell is in place, providing a clean working environment for subsequent development without implementing any user-facing features. This foundational work is critical for enabling continuous integration and deployment from the outset.

### Story 1.1: Project Repository Setup

As a developer,
I want to set up the project repository with appropriate `.gitignore` and initial folder structure,
so that development can begin in an organized manner.

**Acceptance Criteria (Refined):**
1.  A `.gitignore` file exists at the root and is configured to ignore common Python (`__pycache__/`, `*.pyc`), Node.js (`node_modules/`, `.next/`), and OS-specific (`.DS_Store`, `Thumbs.db`) files.
2.  The root directory contains `backend/`, `frontend/`, and `docs/` subdirectories.
3.  The repository is initialized with Git, and a root-level `README.md` file has been created with the project title.

### Story 1.2: Basic Application Scaffolding

As a developer,
I want to scaffold a minimal FastAPI backend and a minimal Next.js frontend,
so that we have a deployable and verifiable application shell.

**Acceptance Criteria (Refined):**
1.  The `frontend/` directory contains a default Next.js application, runnable via `npm run dev`.
2.  The `backend/` directory contains a `main.py` with a basic FastAPI app and can be started using `uvicorn`. A `requirements.txt` (or `pyproject.toml`) managed by `uv` lists `fastapi` and `uvicorn`.
3.  The FastAPI application implements a `/health` endpoint that returns a JSON response: `{"status": "ok"}`.
4.  A developer can run both applications locally at the same time without port conflicts.

### Story 1.3: Initial Database Setup

As a developer,
I want to set up and initialize the SQLite database with the required tables,
so that the application has a persistent data layer for future features.

**Acceptance Criteria:**
1.  The `sqlalchemy` library is added to the backend dependencies using `uv`.
2.  The FastAPI application is configured to connect to a local SQLite database file (e.g., `simple-todo.db`).
3.  A database initialization script or function exists that, when run, creates the database file and a `users` table.
4.  The `users` table includes columns for at least `id` (primary key), `email` (unique), and `hashed_password`.

### Story 1.4: Initial Deployment Configuration

As a developer,
I want to configure basic deployment settings for the minimal application,
so that we can verify continuous integration and deployment processes.

**Acceptance Criteria (Refined):**
1.  The `backend/` directory contains a multi-stage `Dockerfile` that installs dependencies using `uv` and runs the FastAPI application.
2.  The project contains a GitHub Actions workflow file (e.g., `.github/workflows/deploy.yml`).
3.  When code is pushed to the `main` branch, the GitHub Action automatically:
    a. Builds the backend Docker image and pushes it to the DigitalOcean Container Registry.
    b. Triggers a deployment of the new image to a DigitalOcean App Platform app.
    c. Triggers a deployment of the Next.js frontend to a separate DigitalOcean App Platform app.
4.  The deployed Next.js application successfully makes a request to the deployed backend's `/health` endpoint and displays a "Backend is healthy" message on the page.

## Epic 2: User Management

**Expanded Goal:** This epic aims to implement the core functionalities for user identity and access, enabling users to securely create accounts, log in, log out, and manage their basic profile information. This is a critical step to personalize the application and secure user data, building upon the foundational setup established in Epic 1.

### Story 2.1: User Registration

As a new user,
I want to create a secure account,
so that I can access the application's features.

**Acceptance Criteria:**
1.  A public API endpoint (e.g., `POST /register`) exists on the FastAPI backend that accepts an email and password.
2.  The password is securely hashed (e.g., using `passlib`) before being stored in the `users` table.
3.  The endpoint returns a success response upon creating a new user.
4.  The endpoint returns a 400-level error if the email already exists or if the password doesn't meet basic strength requirements (e.g., minimum length).
5.  A registration form is created in the Next.js frontend that successfully calls this endpoint.

### Story 2.2: User Login and Logout

As a registered user,
I want to securely log in and log out of the application,
so that I can access my personal data and protect my privacy.

**Acceptance Criteria:**
1.  A public API endpoint (e.g., `POST /token`) exists on the FastAPI backend that accepts an email and password.
2.  Upon successful authentication, the endpoint returns a secure access token (e.g., JWT).
3.  The endpoint returns a 401 Unauthorized error for invalid credentials.
4.  A login form in the Next.js app calls this endpoint and securely stores the token upon success.
5.  The Next.js app has a "Logout" button that clears the stored token, effectively ending the user's session.

### Story 2.3: Basic User Profile Management

As a logged-in user,
I want to view and update my basic profile information (e.g., email, password),
so that I can manage my account details.

**Acceptance Criteria:**
1.  A protected API endpoint (e.g., `GET /users/me`) exists that returns the current user's information based on their authentication token.
2.  A protected API endpoint (e.g., `PUT /users/me/password`) allows the user to change their password after verifying their current password.
3.  All protected endpoints return a 401 Unauthorized error if a valid token is not provided.
4.  A basic "Profile" page exists in the Next.js app, displaying the user's email and providing a form to change their password.

## Epic 3: Core Task Management

**Expanded Goal:** This epic aims to implement the fundamental capabilities for users to manage their personal tasks within the application. It will enable users to create, view, update, and delete tasks, along with defining essential task properties, forming the core utility of the to-do application.

### Story 3.1: Task Creation

As a logged-in user,
I want to create new tasks with essential properties,
so that I can add items to my to-do list.

**Acceptance Criteria:**
1.  A protected API endpoint (e.g., `POST /tasks`) exists that accepts a description, category, and deadline.
2.  The endpoint validates the input and creates a new task record in the database, linking it to the authenticated user.
3.  The new task is assigned a default status of 'To Do'.
4.  A form exists on the main dashboard of the Next.js app for creating a new task.
5.  Submitting the form calls the API and the new task appears on the user's task list without needing a page refresh.

### Story 3.2: View Task List

As a logged-in user,
I want to view a list of my tasks,
so that I can see what I need to do.

**Acceptance Criteria:**
1.  A protected API endpoint (e.g., `GET /tasks`) exists that returns a list of all tasks belonging to the authenticated user.
2.  The Next.js app fetches and displays this list on the main dashboard when the user is logged in.
3.  Each task in the list clearly displays its description, category, deadline, and status.
4.  The tasks are displayed in a clear and organized manner (e.g., sorted by deadline).

### Story 3.3: Update Task

As a logged-in user,
I want to modify existing tasks,
so that I can keep my to-do list accurate and up-to-date.

**Acceptance Criteria:**
1.  A protected API endpoint (e.g., `PUT /tasks/{task_id}`) allows updating a task's description, category, deadline, and status.
2.  The endpoint verifies that the task being updated belongs to the authenticated user.
3.  The UI provides a way to edit a task (e.g., an "Edit" button that opens a modal).
4.  The UI allows changing a task's status (e.g., a dropdown menu with 'To Do', 'In Progress', 'Completed').
5.  Changes are saved and reflected in the task list.

### Story 3.4: Delete Task

As a logged-in user,
I want to remove tasks from my list,
so that I can keep my to-do list clean and relevant.

**Acceptance Criteria:**
1.  A protected API endpoint (e.g., `DELETE /tasks/{task_id}`) removes a task.
2.  The endpoint verifies that the task being deleted belongs to the authenticated user.
3.  The UI provides a "Delete" button for each task.
4.  A confirmation prompt is displayed before the task is permanently deleted.

## Epic 4: Positive Motivation Engine

**Expanded Goal:** This epic aims to implement the unique "Positive Motivation Engine" that differentiates this application. It will focus on providing encouraging feedback upon task completion and displaying clear, scalable metrics to foster a sense of achievement and progress, thereby combating procrastination and building positive momentum for the user.

### Story 4.1: Task Completion Encouragement

As a user,
I want to receive encouraging messages when I complete a task,
so that I feel motivated and acknowledge my progress.

**Acceptance Criteria:**
1.  When a task's status is updated to 'Completed' via the API, the backend response includes a randomized, positive message.
2.  A list of positive messages is stored in the backend (e.g., in a simple list or configuration file).
3.  The Next.js frontend displays this message to the user in a non-intrusive way (e.g., a temporary toast notification).
4.  A mechanism exists to control the frequency of these messages (e.g., the backend only sends a message for the first 5 completed tasks per day).

### Story 4.2: Daily Task Completion Metrics

As a user,
I want to see how many tasks I've completed today,
so that I can track my daily productivity.

**Acceptance Criteria:**
1.  A protected API endpoint (e.g., `GET /metrics/daily`) exists that returns the count of tasks completed by the user for the current day.
2.  The calculation is accurate, considering the user's timezone if possible.
3.  The Next.js app displays this number clearly on the main dashboard.
4.  The metric updates in near real-time when a task is marked as complete.

### Story 4.3: Weekly Task Completion Percentage

As a user,
I want to see my weekly task completion percentage,
so that I can understand my productivity trends over time.

**Acceptance Criteria:**
1.  A protected API endpoint (e.g., `GET /metrics/weekly`) exists that returns the percentage of tasks completed within the current week.
2.  The calculation is clearly defined (e.g., `(completed_tasks_this_week / total_tasks_due_this_week) * 100`).
3.  The Next.js app displays this percentage in a visually clear way (e.g., with a progress bar or a chart).
4.  The calculation is performant and scalable, even for users with a large number of tasks.
