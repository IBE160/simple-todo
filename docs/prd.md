# The Motivational To-Do App Product Requirements Document (PRD)

## Goals and Background Context

### Goals

*   Drive user adoption and sustained engagement by creating a tool that demonstrably helps students feel more motivated and in control of their schedules.
*   Validate the "Positive Motivation Engine" as a core feature that effectively increases task completion and user satisfaction.

### Background Context

This project aims to develop a simple-to-do application using Node.js, specifically tailored for busy college students. The primary challenge it addresses is the pervasive feeling of being overwhelmed and the resulting tendency to procrastinate among students. Traditional to-do applications often exacerbate this issue by becoming a source of guilt when users fall behind, failing to provide the necessary motivational support to combat procrastination and build positive momentum.

## Requirements

### Functional Requirements

*   **FR1:** Users must be able to create a private account, log in, and log out.
*   **FR2:** The application must provide a single, clean user interface for a logged-in user to perform all core CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations on their personal tasks.
*   **FR3:** Each task must have a description, category (e.g., 'Academics', 'Work'), a deadline, and a status (e.g., 'To Do', 'Completed').
*   **FR4:** The application must provide encouraging notifications/messages when a task is marked as complete, with a mechanism to manage notification frequency to prevent user fatigue.
*   **FR5:** The application must display simple, clear, and scalable metrics like "Tasks completed today" or "Weekly completion percentage" tied to the user's account, ensuring performance and usability even with high task volumes.

### Non-Functional Requirements

*   **NFR1:** The application must be a Web Application, accessible via desktop and mobile browsers.
*   **NFR2:** The application must support the latest stable versions of major browsers (Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge).
*   **NFR3:** The user interface must be fast and responsive to ensure seamless task management.
*   **NFR4:** Standard security practices must be implemented, including secure password hashing for user accounts and protection of all user data.

## User Interface Design Goals

### Overall UX Vision

The application's overall UX vision is to provide a clean, intuitive dashboard that empowers busy college students to manage their tasks effectively while fostering a sense of motivation and control. The "Positive Motivation Engine" is central to this, delivering positive feedback and encouraging messages, alongside simple, clear metrics. The aim is a coaching-style app that supports students in managing both their workload and their motivation, creating a virtuous cycle of "small wins."

### Key Interaction Paradigms

Users should be able to easily create, view, update, and delete their tasks through a streamlined interface. Key interactions will include receiving encouraging notifications upon task completion and viewing simple, clear displays of their progress metrics. The focus is on minimizing friction and maximizing positive reinforcement.

### Core Screens and Views

From a product perspective, the most critical screens and views necessary to deliver the PRD's value and goals include:

*   **Account Management Screens:** For user creation, login, and logout.
*   **Main Task Dashboard:** The central hub for managing all personal tasks.
*   **Task Detail/Edit View:** For creating new tasks and viewing/modifying existing task properties.
*   **Motivation/Metrics Display:** A dedicated area or component to show progress metrics and motivational feedback.

### Accessibility

**None**

### Branding

No specific branding elements or style guides have been identified at this stage. The design will aim for a clean, modern aesthetic by default.

### Target Device and Platforms

**Web Responsive** (accessible via desktop and mobile browsers).

## Technical Assumptions

### Repository Structure: Monorepo

For the MVP, a **Monorepo** is assumed, containing both the frontend and backend code. This simplifies development and deployment for a small team.

### Service Architecture: Monolith

A **Monolithic** architecture is assumed for the MVP. The backend will serve a REST or GraphQL API. This approach is sufficient for the initial scope and allows for faster development.

### Testing Requirements: Unit + Integration

For the MVP, **Unit and Integration Testing** are assumed to be the primary testing requirements. This provides a good balance of code quality and development speed. Further testing (e.g., E2E, manual) can be considered post-MVP.

### Additional Technical Assumptions and Requests

*   **Backend Technology:** Node.js, likely using the Express.js framework.
*   **Frontend Technology:** A modern JavaScript framework such as React, Vue, or Svelte. The specific choice will be made by the development team, but it should support a dynamic user experience.
*   **Database:** A database capable of handling user data and task relationships, such as PostgreSQL (relational) or MongoDB (NoSQL). The specific choice will be made by the Architect.
*   **Hosting/Infrastructure:** A cloud-based platform like Vercel, Heroku, or a major cloud provider (AWS, GCP, Azure).
*   **Security:** Standard security practices must be implemented, including secure password hashing for user accounts and protection of all user data.

## Epic List

*   **Epic 1: Core Application Setup:** Establish the foundational application structure, including repository setup, basic build processes, and a deployable, minimal application shell (e.g., a health check endpoint or a simple landing page) without specific user-facing features.
*   **Epic 2: User Management:** Implement secure user accounts, including registration, login, logout, and basic user profile management.
*   **Epic 3: Core Task Management:** Implement the essential task management capabilities, allowing users to create, read, update, and delete their personal tasks, along with defining basic task properties like description, category, deadline, and status.
*   **Epic 4: Positive Motivation Engine:** Develop and integrate the motivational features, including encouraging notifications upon task completion and the display of key performance metrics to foster a sense of achievement and progress.

## Epic 1: Core Application Setup

**Expanded Goal:** This epic aims to establish the fundamental technical infrastructure for the application.
