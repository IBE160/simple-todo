## User Interface Design Goals

### Overall UX Vision

The application's overall UX vision is to provide a clean, intuitive dashboard that empowers busy college students to manage their tasks effectively while fostering a sense of motivation and control. The "Positive Motivation Engine" is central to this, delivering positive feedback and encouraging messages, alongside simple, clear metrics. The aim is a coaching-style app that supports students in managing both their workload and their motivation, creating a virtuous cycle of "small wins."

### Key Interaction Paradigms

Users should be able to easily create, view, update, and delete their tasks through a streamlined interface. Key interactions will include receiving encouraging notifications upon task completion and viewing simple, clear displays of their progress metrics. The focus is on minimizing friction and maximizing positive reinforcement.

### Core Screens and Views

From a product perspective, the most critical screens and views necessary to deliver the PRD's value and goals include:

*   **Account Management Screens:** For user creation, login, and logout.
*   **Main Task Dashboard:** The central hub for managing all personal tasks.
*   **Task Detail/Edit View:** For creating new tasks and viewing/modifying existing task properties.
*   **Motivation/Metrics Display:** A dedicated area or component to show progress metrics and motivational feedback.
