    *   *Rationale:* The features are logically sequenced into four epics, representing a clear prioritization for an MVP build.
*   **3.2. User Journeys Considered:** **PASS**

    *   *Rationale:* Technical constraints and preferences have been clearly documented, providing clear guidance for the Architect.
*   **4.3. Dependencies Acknowledged:** **PASS**
    *   *Rationale:* The story breakdown is sequential, ensuring dependencies (like database setup before user registration) are correctly ordered.

### 5. Structure & Clarity
