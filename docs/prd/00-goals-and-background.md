## Goals and Background Context

### Goals

*   Drive user adoption and sustained engagement by creating a tool that demonstrably helps students feel more motivated and in control of their schedules.
*   Validate the "Positive Motivation Engine" as a core feature that effectively increases task completion and user satisfaction.

### Background Context

This project aims to develop a simple-to-do application using Node.js, specifically tailored for busy college students. The primary challenge it addresses is the pervasive feeling of being overwhelmed and the resulting tendency to procrastinate among students. Traditional to-do applications often exacerbate this issue by becoming a source of guilt when users fall behind, failing to provide the necessary motivational support to combat procrastination and build positive momentum.
