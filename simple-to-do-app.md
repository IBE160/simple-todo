# Simple TO-DO app

## Analyst - creating the project brief

<prompt>
I would like to create a simple to-do app to demonstrate the be mad method. This should be a very simple Node.js background application. What I really want to brainstorm about is some of the ideas we can do to at least make it a little bit interesting. Let's play some of your brainstorming games and see what we can come up with.

A student should be able to easily create to-do's in order to manage their classes, their appointments, their part-time job, their social life, and of course their classes. They should know what time they should be there, what they're supposed to do before they go to the class, and  of course do homework afterwards. They should also be able to track how well they're doing and get some kind of notification sometime before a deadline so they know it's soon approaching. It would also be nice to get some positive feedback if you are able to keep the to-do's and if you're behind, you should get some notification to motivate you to do it. Always be positive. I also would like to have a dashboard like seeing older to-do's and being able to update, delete, and create to-do's.

Well, the time is a small project, maybe taking two hours. There's no specific libraries.You should tell me if I need some specific libraries. Target users are students, and we're not aiming for a broad exploration of many different ideas. Instead, we should focus on a few concepts more deeply.
